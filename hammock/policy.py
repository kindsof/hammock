class Policy(object):
    """
    Define routing policies using a policy json file.
    A policy rule is according to oslo.policy.
    A rule has a name and a boolean expression that is evaluated using the
    headers and target resource parameters.
    - The headers are converted to a credentials dict, by default using hammock.types.Credentials,
      but can be customized using credentials_class parameter.
    - The request is converted to a dict using hammock engine, and passed to oslo.policy as
      the target field.
    - Evaluating the expression:
      The expression is key:value tuple, The key might be:
      * rule: then the target is reference to another rule.
      * role: then the value is looked up in a list stored in a key 'roles' in the credentials dict.
      * other: the key is searched in the credentials rules, and then the value is compared after
        evaluating the python expression: value % target
        Example:
        rule is 'credentials_entry:%(target_entry)s', then
        if credentials are {'credentials_entry': 'x'} and target is {'target_entry': 'x'},
        then the rule is evaluated to True.
    - The expression might have and/or parentheses.
